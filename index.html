    <h2>Welcome to Cali's official website. </h2>
    <p>First of all, a few facts about this great Colombian city:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Founded on 1536</li>
      <li>Population of 2,400,000</li>
      <li>Located near the pacific coast (specifics in our <a href="location.html">location</a> tab)</li>
      <li>Vibrant culture, Salsa music capital of the world</li>
      <li>Find out more in the city's <a href="http://www.cali.gov.co/" target="_blank">official website</a></li>

  <p>This <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/southwest-colombia/cali" target="_blank">Lonely Planet</a> site about Cali is great - from the beautiful dropdown menus up in the navbar to the use of white space and minimalism. Simple, yet the few objects on the site interact very smoothly and pleasantly with the user. It responds well to adjusting the width of the browser, changing to a mobile-friendly design when browser was made narrow. The positioning of text over images is a great visual, like the form for hotel check-in or the "launch map view" button over the map image.</p>
    <p>In the Lonely Planet site you can find some SECTION, CONTAINER and ARTICLE html tags around most of the content blocks in the index (home) page. Although they seem similar, it seems like SECTION tags are more generic as the other two are always inside a SECTION tag. The ARTICLE tags are usually within a CONTAINER tag (although not always). ARTICLE is most specific, it appears to be used to capture the essential elements that make a section, not including perhaps white spaces and other objects around it. I assume it is to allow easy ways to know what the code for the stand-alone content is (article), and then what the code for the content plus other objects and spacing around it is (CONTAINER, SECTION). </p>
